# confluence-analysis

Score confluence WITH evidence shown, never a naked number.

## Binance Agent OS data policy

Binance Agent OS is the **canonical data backend** for this library.
- Use the connected Binance Agent OS capabilities for crypto data.
- Do not replace Binance with another exchange or data provider.
- The skills are runtime/model agnostic: they can be loaded by Hermes, Claude, ChatGPT, or another compatible agent, while Binance Agent OS remains the data source.
- Prefer capability discovery over hardcoding a particular tool/function name.
- Preserve Binance-native timestamps, venue/market type, chain, availability and validity flags.
- If Binance Agent OS does not expose a required field, record it `MISSING`/`UNSUPPORTED` in the internal evidence layer only — per the **Missing Data Silence Rule** (see AGENTS.md), never surface it in user-facing output.
- Never fabricate a value or silently substitute an unrelated metric.

## analysis rules

- Separate `OBSERVED`, `INFERRED`, `POSSIBLE`, and `UNKNOWN`.
- Preserve source and timestamp for numeric evidence.
- Prefer asset-relative and historical baselines over universal thresholds.
- Distinguish spot, derivatives and Web3/on-chain evidence.
- Never infer motives, identity, insider status or causation from insufficient evidence.
- Scores are summaries only; evidence comes first.
- Confidence reflects data quality, freshness, coverage and contradictions.
- This library is research/intelligence only. Do not issue personalized BUY/SELL/LONG/SHORT instructions.

## Inputs
Symbol

## Method
Collect votes from relative-strength, volume, smart-money,
liquidity, open-interest, funding. Each signal votes check/cross/dash WITH its data line.

## Output contract (use these exact section headers)
CONFLUENCE - $SYMBOL
CHECKLIST: signal | vote | evidence line
SCORE: n/total (after evidence, not before)
WHAT WOULD CHANGE THE ANSWER: named falsifier
